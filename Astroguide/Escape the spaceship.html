        <h1>Escape the Spaceship</h1>
        <p>Escape the Spaceship is a multilevel adventure game based upon the butterfly effect, with small changes effecting decisions and characters you may meet later in the game. The preface is simple, Escape the Spaceship. Ever time you run into a problem, you will be given a set of items with which you may attempt to solve the problem. Make no mistake, though, the game may feel it important to kill you and subsequentially mock you mercilessly if you make any sort of stupid mistake. For example, using an explosive to diffuse a bomb will most likely result in immediate and painful death. </p>
        <p>This brings us to the next great part of this game. The game will restart you from this screen whenever you die. That way, you can go through the entire game again making the right choices. Be warned, though, there is more than one way through this game, and even more ways to die horrible deaths. There are currently over one hundred different options! But don't think you have to die alone! This game inputs the "body count" system. Throughout the game, your decisions will most likely cause horrible deaths for many humans and aliens alike. But don't think you can just forget about all the deaths you've caused. The game will keep track. Every time you die, the game will happily inform you how much of a terrible person you were.</p>
        <p>However, when you click start, remember this. There is no going back, unless you die. This means that if you feel you have made the wrong choice, your sunk. It was your fault, and it will probably come back to bite you in the future. Anyhow, the whole point of this paragraph is to take up space on the opening page. So, was our tutorial long enough? Did it bore you to tears? Good! Now, if you wish to start the game, merely click the button below!</p>

Well, it turns out that when you so humourously went up in sparks and smoke, there just so happened to be a few aliens passing by in the corridor when you went up like a fireworks display!

Not only are you falling at break-neck speeds towards a bloody demise of the floor below, but you seem to have also fallen into the engine room, and your worried that anything easily flamable will automatically burst into flame from the heat.</p><button onclick="m6()">Bungee</button><button onclick="m7()">Antigravity</button><button onclick="m8()">Parachute</button><button onclick="m9()">Spring Boots</button>';

function m7() {	document.getElementById('output').innerHTML='<h1>Game Over</h1><p>You mash the Antigravity button, and then you feel yourself slow down... and then start falling upwards. You fly up, out of the engine room... and right into the hard metal cieling of the Hold, becoming a red splotch on the cieling. Wow, you\'re so inconsiderate. Couldn\'t you have died on the floor where it would be easier for the poor Janitor to clean you up?</p>';
							}
function m8() {	document.getElementById('output').innerHTML='<h1>Game Over</h1><p>Remember that whole sentence up above where I mentioned the whole thing about flamable objects. Well, yah. You just had to pull a giant sail of lightweight cloth out of your pack. I know you think you know where this is going, but your wrong, it\'s far worse. not only do you burn up in the air, but your corpse stays in the air just long enough for the large engines to suck up your chard corpse and chew it down into fuel. Then, now fuel, your remains are turned into fuel for the ships guns, becuase the aliens are running low.

			document.getElementById('output').innerHTML='<h1>Location: The Vents</h1><p>Okay, time for some science trivia before we get back to te game. Basically how gravity works is that third dimensional objects cause indents in the fourth dimension. If that doesn\'t make any sense, allow me to try to create an accurate representation of what gravity is. So, you have a picnic blanket strung tawt between two tables. THen, you drop a bowling ball onto that blanket. Because of how much mass is in the ball, it creates an indent in the blanket. Then, any other objects dropped on the blanket of lower mass with roll towards the bowling ball. This is essentially how gravity works, except that the blanket is the fourth dimension of SpaceTIme, and the bowling ball is an object in the third dimension. This is why the Gravity Gun is such a deadly weapon. It creates a small, almost infinetly dense pocket of air for less than a second. Why this is so bad is that anything standing directly in front of the weapon will feel the force of a black hole for one split second. This is because the incredibly dense marble of air is creating a huge rupture in the fourth dimension, tearing and shredding anything in front of it. That is why, when you pull the trigger, there is a flash of light, a horrible howling sound, and then everything within ten feet of the alien is torn into shreds. However, another biproduct of the black hole was the noise, alerting all the aliens in the area to your presence. As you stumble to your feet after the blast, you hear the clip clop of metal boots, as alien patrol after alien patrol rounds the corner, their rifles trained on you.</p><button onclick="m98()">Meteor Storm</button><button onclick="m99()">Companion Cube</button><button onclick="m100()">Duck</button><button onclick="m101()">Diamond Sword</button>';
